            <p>
                PassPath uses a path chosen by the user to authenticate them with the given system. <br>
                It uses google maps street view api which provides a recognisable and comfortable environment to choose a route anywhere in the world. <br>
                PassPath then stores this route as your way of authenticating with the given system. <br>
                When that same user wants to access the system they simply need to repeat the route they initially gave the system.

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Do not double back on yourself / press back. Its best to just start again if you make a mistake. (back to start location button)</li>
                <li>If you wish to re enter your name or visit a new location, simply refresh the page to start fresh</li>
                <li>Your passPath must be at least 200m long</li>
                <li>Your name is not stored but you must enter the same name every time</li>
                <li>Ensure you place streetview onto a road.</li>
