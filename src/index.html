            PassPath asks the user to plot a route of their choosing, using google maps street view. <br>
            Anywhere in the world.<br>
            PassPath then stores this route as your way of authenticating with the given system. <br>
            When that same user wants to access the system they simply need to repeat the route they initially gave the system.

            <img src="./backToStartBtn.png"/> - This button will take you back to the location where you clicked start and allow you to reposition the start of your PassPath.
            <br>
            <img src="./startAgainBtn.png"/> - This button will reset your PassPath attempt and allow you to enter a different name and a completely different PassPath. It does the same as refreshing the browser.
